Hi I'm Ashley, I'm a software engineer based in Auckland, New Zealand. I love to create software products, particularly early-stage SaaS. I built an ecommerce accounting service called [A2X](https://www.a2xaccounting.com). Currently working on a tool to automate accounts receivable processes called [Paidnice](https://www.paidnice.com).


There was a blog about ecommerce software here once upon a time, you can find the archive [here](/blog-archive/) if you want some nostalgia about Magento, AWS, Google Cloud or Ecommerce from 2008-2017.

I sporadically post articles on this site which you can find below.
