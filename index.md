I'm a software engineer based in Auckland, New Zealand. I build software products, particularly early-stage SaaS. I co-founded and built an ecommerce accounting service called [A2X](https://www.a2xaccounting.com) to become the world's leading ecommerce integration for accurate ecommerce accounting. Currently working on a service to automate accounts receivable processes called [Paidnice](https://www.paidnice.com) that intergates Xero and QuickBooks to business accounts receaivle workflows.

My passion and experience is building products customers love with highly scalable integrations in a range of industries: finance and accounting (Stripe, Xero, QuickBooks, Sage and NetSuite), ecommerce (Amazon, Shopify, eBay, Etsy and Walmart).

There was a blog about ecommerce software and several open-source ecommerce tools I built here once upon a time, you can find the archive [here](/blog-archive/) if you want some nostalgia about Magento, AWS, Google Cloud or Ecommerce from 2008-2017.

These days I write articles here on software and business.
