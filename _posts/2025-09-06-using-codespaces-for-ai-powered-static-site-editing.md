## Introduction

This post documents the steps to use GitHub Codespaces for AI-powered editing of a static site hosted on GitHub Pages. Codespaces provides a cloud-based development environment, making it easy to edit, preview, and deploy changes to your site from anywhere.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A repository configured for GitHub Pages
- Access to GitHub Codespaces

## Steps

### 1. Open Your Repository in Codespaces

- Navigate to your GitHub Pages repository on GitHub.
- Click the **Code** button, then select **Codespaces** > **Create codespace on main**.

### 2. Set Up the Development Environment

- Codespaces will automatically set up the environment based on your repository's configuration (e.g., Jekyll for static sites).
- Wait for the environment to initialize.

### 3. Edit Your Site

- Use the built-in VS Code editor to modify site files (Markdown, HTML, CSS, etc.).
- For AI-powered editing, use extensions like GitHub Copilot to assist with content creation and code suggestions.

### 4. Preview Changes Locally

- Start the local server (e.g., Jekyll) using the provided devcontainer script or terminal command:

  ```bash
  .devcontainer/start-jekyll.sh
  ```

- Preview your site in the browser using the forwarded port or the Simple Browser extension.

### 5. Commit and Push Changes

- After editing, commit your changes:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Update site content using Codespaces"
  git push
  ```

### 6. Deploy to GitHub Pages

- GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy your site from the repository.
- Visit your site URL to verify the changes.

## Benefits

- **Cloud-based editing**: No local setup required.
- **AI assistance**: Use Copilot for faster content and code generation.
- **Instant preview**: See changes before deploying.
- **Seamless deployment**: Push to GitHub to update your live site.

## Conclusion

Using Codespaces with GitHub Pages and AI tools streamlines the workflow for static site editing, making it accessible and efficient for developers and content creators.
