		<description><![CDATA[Ashley, first of all, congratulations for all your work. They’re all amazing, without exception.

But I assume I come here to ask for another kind of help. From zero to something really annoying, my magento (1.5.1.0) store began associating wrong download link files for each and every new order. I’m really lost and don’t know what to do. It is really strange, since the store didn’t pass any major changes since the last correct order, in which all files are available correctly.

I thank you very much in advance for your kindnesse and attention and hope you could help or assist me in anyway.

Keep up the good work. You surely are one of the greatest Magento talents I’ve ever come accross on the web.

Best regards,

Raimundo

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ashley,

Great post! We&#039;re actually the company that developed the rig for the results you so kindly described as &quot;public tests coming through with incredible performance profiles&quot;. That&#039;s for a client of ours, coastalscents.com. The site was on one of the clients on the &quot;compare hosts&quot; which to protect the innocent we won&#039;t name, but wasn&#039;t delivering the speed or power they needed for their very large sales so they came to us. The site is now is live on that rig, tuned to a much higher level. Notice the longest transaction and shorts &#038; average time have all gone down dramatically on the test I ran today: http://www.magespeedtest.com/results?key=f710c375-546f-4112-b721-5c7d9ff695ca . 

This is using an acceleration framework we developed in-house, and it uses only 3 (cloud) servers. If you (or anyone else for that matter) is interested in how we did it, we&#039;d be happy to chat about it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ashley,

We&#039;re just in the process of upgrading our site to 1.7 and trying to implement tips &#038; techniques I&#039;ve learnt over the past couple of years and improve our magento site. Any chance I&#039;m in the first three responses.

Cheers,
