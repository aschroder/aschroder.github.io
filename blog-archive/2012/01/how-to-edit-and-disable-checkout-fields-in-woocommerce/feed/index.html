		<description><![CDATA[Hi there, I am not a developer, can you just give me the copy to drop in 
the document class-wc-checkout.php 
It&#039;s such a shame that they developed a wonderful system but left out this most simplest task, the custom checkout page would deter anyone who wants to buy an item. Mine is a digital store. So, i only would need name and email address. Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@AAA, I just copied the entire thing above and pasted it in the function.php of my theme. This is a custom theme so I don&#039;t have to be concerned about an update overwriting the code. If you are then you can place the file disable checkout fields in your plugin folder on your server root/wp-content/plugins/disable-checkout-fields.php. Then go to the &quot;installed plugins&quot; screen of the WP UI and activate it.

@Rolly, on line 41 of the disable-checkout-fields.php file you can add ,&#039;billing_phone&#039; right after &#039;billing_state&#039;. Don&#039;t for get the comma then it will look like this: &#039;billing_state&#039;, &#039;billing_phone&#039;. Then on lines 62 through 67 delete:

				&#039;billing_phone&#039;         =&#062; array(
					&#039;label&#039;                 =&#062; __(&#039;Phone&#039;,&#039;wc_disable_checkout_fields&#039;),
					&#039;placeholder&#039;   	=&#062; __(&#039;Phone number&#039;,&#039;wc_disable_checkout_fields&#039;),
					&#039;required&#039;              =&#062; true,
					&#039;class&#039;                 =&#062; array(&#039;form-row-first&#039;)
					)

Then you should be all set.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you very much for this contribution. It works perfect and does the heavy lifting for me. I am using it to give a client what they are requesting. However on a store I manage I pass the billing information to PayPal. Then they use it to authorize credit cards by billing address. Have you heard of this causing problems with PayPal or Google Wallet? I am going to do some testing and might have to turn off the option to pass the information to PayPal.]]></description>
