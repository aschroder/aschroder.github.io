		<description><![CDATA[That video got pulled, here&#039;s another copy that currently works:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWsNzAHtOto 

(I think that&#039;s the one anyway...)

It&#039;s an interesting problem. A lot of us were/are working more hours doing things we don&#039;t necessarily love doing, in order to make more money so we can try and get what we think we want. But you end up with less time and that whatever it is gets more expensive all the time anyway. So rather than work more to try and earn more in order to be able to spend more, could we not substantially reduce costs of living so we can work less and actually have time to appreciate the many beautiful things that don&#039;t cost all that much money anyway?!

It also reminds of that dumb thing called Status. A great definition of status being: Spending money you don&#039;t have on things you don&#039;t need to impress people you don&#039;t like. And we work our socks off for it and get all hung up about it... Stupid. 

Wish I realised these things when I was 18 instead of the penny dropping around the big three oh. But there&#039;s time still!]]></description>
