		<description><![CDATA[Very nice and useful.  However, how does it handle a 503 being returned?  I noticed on some of my tests, I was getting WAY better scores with 100 concurrent users, but I&#039;m thinking that the server is just pushing back 503 at a very fast rate?  Let me know and thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this looks great, however, with the page caching we have enabled, the pages serve up pretty quickly. Like the previous commenter, we&#039;re most in need of a testing tool that emulates the shopping experience, particularly, &quot;add-to-cart&quot; and &quot;site-search&quot;. Do you have any load testing that can emulate that functionality?]]></description>
