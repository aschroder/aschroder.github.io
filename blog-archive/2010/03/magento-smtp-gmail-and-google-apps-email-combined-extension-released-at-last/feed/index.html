		<description><![CDATA[I installed the extension and it works great for built-in email functions!

I have a custom built module that sends mail... which of course isn&#039;t working.  is there a way for me to hook into your extension&#039;s email send method?  Please advise,

Thank you!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

First of all, thanks to you for your SMTP tool.
I have a problem above all and I don’t passed the test.
I have this configuration:

----SMTP Pro Email General Settings

Choose extension option :Google Apps/Gmail
Development Mode options :Development Mode Disabled
Log all messages :YES

----SMTP Pro Email Google Apps/Gmail Settings
Email Address:info@adorepearls.com	
Password:*******

----SMTP Pro Email SMTP Settings

Authentication : login	
Username : info@adorepearls.com	
Password :******	
Host : smtp.gmail.com
Port : 465
SSL Security : SSL TLS

The result of the test is:
ASchroder.com SMTP Pro Self-test results
Testing outbound connectivity to Server:
Using Google Apps/Gmail configuration options
Failed to connect to SMTP server. Reason: Connection timed out(110)
This extension requires an outbound SMTP connection on port: 587

Please check and double check your username and password.
Contact Form test email did not use SMTPPro to send.
Testing failed, please review the reported problems and if you need further help visit ASchroder.com to contact me.

If I change the following parameters to:
Port: 465
SSL security: NO SSL

----Other step:
When I try to telnet to gmail with the next command in the prompt system:
telnet smtp.gmail.com 25, I have the conection and get some words below:
220 mx.google.com ESMTP jz4sm5452449pbc.17

telnet smtp.gmail.com 465, I have the conection and get nothing;

telnet smtp.gmail.com 587, I can not connect to it:

C:\Documents and Settings\jacklee.li&#062;telnet smtp.gmail.com 587
Connecting to smtp.gmail.com ... can not open connection to the host, on port 587: Connect failed

and there is nothing in the email log.

Do you have any idea?

Thank you very much
Best regards]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using the SMTPPro on my Magento 1.6.0 installation.
It really works great! 
It solves the Magento SMTP bug as sending Mail as apchache@ ...

But although it is working great, SMTPpro still reports the DEBUG(7) logs in the Magento Systemlog. 
Can I turn this logging off?? it&#039;s really messing up my log with a lot of unnecessary lines of log entries that say, &quot;No problems, it works great&quot;. I only want to see real errors in my system log...

Thanx in Advance...]]></description>

I looked at the code and in the contacts.phtml file I see this code which I think is the submit button:

		<description><![CDATA[First, great extension! I have tested using the built in self test as well as a new customer creation and I am getting both emails! The issue I am having is when I submit a contact form.

What I have is a contact form put on a static CMS page. I am also using reCAPTCHA to prevent spam. I have this code in the page layout --&#062; Layout Update XML section:

 

 
  


The form appears on the page and appears to be &#039;working&#039;. I fill in the fields and type the captcha and hit &quot;Submit&quot; button. The page refreshes and I now see the empty contact form. The problem is, I never get the contact email.

I looked at the code and in the contacts.phtml file I see this code which I think is the submit button:

&#060;button type=&#034;submit&#034; title=&#034;__(&#039;Submit&#039;) ?&#062;&quot; class=&quot;button&quot;&#062;__(&#039;Submit&#039;) ?&#062;

My question is, you comment that if they aren&#039;t using the Magento default send the extension won&#039;t work. Can you tell from the above code what I have going on?

Thanks,
Brad]]></description>
