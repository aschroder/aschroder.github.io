		<description><![CDATA[Ah, cool. I&#039;ll go for the 1.0.2 then. I know how to install manually, but I just found your more recent post with the directory structure. I&#039;ll paste here for others&#039; reference. Of course, once Magento Connect has it, this is moot. ;)

`copy the Aschroder directory into $magento_base/app/code/community and the file in the modules directory goes into $magento_base/app/etc/modules , then just refresh your magento cache`

Thanks for creating this, btw. So useful. As are your other posts... I pretty much read them all b/c they&#039;re exactly what I (we all) need to do, e.g., your post on 3 easy steps to add categories to a cms page, I just reference that every time I need to do it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, either version is 1.4 compatible - if you&#039;re comfortable installing extensions manually then get 1.0.2 - Paulius&#039; version is not much different, but just a bit easier to extract (still requires manual install though). I&#039;m working on a new release for Magento Connect - it won&#039;t let me upload 1.0.{2,3,4...} but I have a 1.1 stream in development - I&#039;m adding optional email logging, I see the paid SMTP extension being sold has that feature, can&#039;t be outdone by the commercial folks!]]></description>
