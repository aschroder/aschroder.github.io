		<description><![CDATA[@Nathan - thanks for sharing your thoughts. We&#039;ve had a lot of success implementing a request for user feedback experiment through a couple of our stores.

		<description><![CDATA[Yes i agree totally ashly, worked for a company, they have trademe feedbacks, and have their own email servers (well. downloading all mails from gmail)

Their way of getting product ranked high on google, is to provide trademe feedback automatically ON the product listing page. 

User is doing all the work. I was hopping to make some email comms public, sothat there&#039;s much much more content, more like facebook, just make it public, as long as you reserve the name &#038; email addresses...gives you much more organic content and keyword hits with all search engines..

Also auto facebook&#039;s like, or review after sales service &#038; product experience, it would be some great sales tools and business process measurement tool... i find myself associating more slides and content with facebook, and come back later to read it...but not necessary &quot;add to wishlist&quot; on the e-store&#039;s website...so there&#039;re some very subtle user behavioural change going on here due to facebook etc..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Ashley.

I think you hit on something with search as Magento&#039;s native one is pretty crap.  I have to spend a lot of time manually looking at the searches and creating redirects to the correct pages. Also I am finding that the position of the search box on the home page is very important.

		<description><![CDATA[Great insights from the IRWD, Ashley. Thanks for taking the time to write them up.

We are also working on ways to improve the customer experience on the sites we work on. Having intuitive product pages with the least amount of &quot;noise&quot; is something we put a lot of importance on. By noise I mean things that explain what the user needs to do. This should  be taken care of by an intuitive design as much as possible. From experience, people don&#039;t really read most of the instructions in small type anyway. So, selecting product options needs to be as visual and intuitive as possible and feedback messages in case of error (and success) need to be obvious and context related.

The problem is that this increases the cost of implementation considerably which sometimes is difficult to justify to the site owner.]]></description>
