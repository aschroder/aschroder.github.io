Our website went from (sometimes) 15s load time to around 2.2s. We are definitely happy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Chris, stay away from Magemojo. Our store was offline for 10 hours on Cybermonday and their support is not helpful at all, when something is wrong it&#039;s always the customer&#039;s fault. A couple of weeks ago we were asking why our server became so slow lately and they responded that bad coding in our template or plugins is the cause (mind that we did not change anything in our code). During this period our store was also several times offline for about 10 - 25 minutes. Some time later in another support ticket, they told us that they were experiencing DDoS attacks during that time (We only found out because we explicitly asked, there was no communication from magemojo&#039;s side at all).

Same goes for &quot;their&quot; Varnish plugin which is in fact just Fabrizio Branca&#039;s aoe_static (the reason why their demo store scores 20+ transactions in magespeedtest). Unfortunately this plugin is not ready for production as it has problems with the top links and the magento message alerts, which is also mentioned on the developer`s site in the comments section. Magemojo`s answer: &quot;You are the only one with this problem&quot;. Sure. No answer from support when pointing out that the bug also appears on their on web site. Besides some other issues like double billing, taking several days to send server login data, ..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Magemojo hands down the worst hosting experience ever. On top of the incompetence (multiple outages w/o logical explanation, double billing, no promised support) incredibly rude when you ask them to address issues. Anger management issues.

 Currently down during the holidays. Blaming a complete network outage on DDoS. Second time in as many months. No one answers phone. Took them 30 minutes just to notice and post that excuse. Stay away]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with Nathan. Had a very poor experience dealing with MageMojo. We considered switching from Nexcess to them. They state on their website that they&#039;re able to perform site-upgrades (at no cost), yet they they&#039;re not actually willing to assist, if there&#039;s any problems with the work that they do. Basically, they performed an upgrade on our Magento installation that didn&#039;t work properly afterwards. We subsequently hired a freelancer to do the same job, which took exactly 1-day and resulted in a perfect-upgrade for us. 

MageMojo is also incredibly unfriendly. When I highlighted some issues that I had with their service and put through our cancellation, they became downright rude:

&quot;The upgrade that was performed was done correctly, period. This is a fact, if you want to live in an alternate reality just so you can pin your mistakes on us we really don&#039;t care. The cancelation has already been processed.&quot;

They clearly have no idea how to deal with customers. 

On the flip-side, Nexcess, who Aschroder has previously reviewed, has been nothing short of stellar, in their service to us. Fast, friendly, helpful. And an excellent platform on which to host Magento.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We run a few eCommerce sites and chose to host with MageMojo after disasters with other hosting companies who lacked core Magento knowledge. Since the minute we migrated to MageMojo, they have been nothing short of incredible. Eric, Martin and the MageMojo team are reliable, knowledgable, experienced and very hard-working. No matter the crossroad, they were able to identify the problem and provided a solution in minutes. As a fast-growing company, it is imperative that our hosting providers can facilitate all our growing transitions and I would not feel comfortable handing this job over to anyone else. If you care about your business and really want to focus more on your BUSINESS... don&#039;t even think twice. Eric and the gang are the real deal. Thanks guys for your continued support!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your review Ashley, it really drove me to choose MageMojo; that and your speedtest. Their price is right, and they seemed amongst the speediest in your running speed test. I was also impressed that they offer moving the site across from the old host for free; that was actually the final straw which made me go for them. My site has a fair bit of customizations, so it took a few days to do the move (not helped by me being in Euro timezone right now), but it did mean it went smoothly. My average page load time went from 9.7s on my local connection to 3.3s :D My old host was excellent, great customer service, but their VPS offerings were much more (and clustered, which is apparently not so good for Magento with the high db access needs). At the moment (maybe 5 days in) I&#039;ll put my vote in with a &#039;highly recommended&#039;.]]></description>
