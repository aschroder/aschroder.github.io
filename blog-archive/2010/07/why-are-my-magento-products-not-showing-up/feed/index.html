		<description><![CDATA[I had the same problem for awhile i followed your steps and they didnt seem to work, so i started again this time i noticed that on the home page in cms the layout update xml was commented out and this was a fresh install of magento, soon as i uncommented the code in the layout update xml section the products were showing up as well as recently viewed products

Hope this will help others with the same problem]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Folks, Got the same issue happening to a site we just launched. Mr Google doesn&#039;t return a solution this time and all my efforts to retrace the bug are in vain. apart from knowing the client was editing the category descriptions. 

I will keep you all posted if a solution comes to mind. otherwise for now if anyone knows why some products (configurable + simple products) disappear from a category let me know

Cheers!
