		<description><![CDATA[Hi I’m having a few problems with the module. Although the test email sends fine. Magento does not seem to be using the module.
I thought that I got working the extension because it sends the test email correctly, but all the other emails are not being sent (like registration one).

		<description><![CDATA[Great extension, Ashley, thanks! Have been using it for about a year now without any issues.

For anyone on a VPS server suddenly getting &quot;535 Incorrect authentication data&quot; error, it is caused by the automatic WHM upgrade which changed one of the server email settings.

So, if you are on a VPS server using SMTP Pro and suddenly all outgoing emails stop working, here is one possible issue to check for:

1) Login to WHM
2) Under Server Configuration, select Tweak Settings
3) Click on the Mail tab
4) Scroll down to &quot;Restrict outgoing SMTP to root, exim, and mailman (FKA SMTP Tweak)&quot; and make sure it&#039;s set to &quot;OFF&quot;
5) Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save

Hope this helps someone with similar setup!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

We are experiencing an issue with confirmation emails being classed as spam by a number of email clients like... Hotmail.

Some of the emails are found in the &quot;Spam&quot; folders but frustratingly, many are not and are not ever received by the customer.

A number of forums are suggesting this extension as a possible fix but we have had this installed for a long time and have been very, very happy with its functionality.

Sadly, this situation has us stumped... Would you have any ideas on a possible resolve?

Thanks in advance]]></description>

I&#039;ve checked all that came to my mind and ran out of ideas.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

I&#039;ve installed 1.4.3 on a Magento 1.5.0.1 version.
Although the extension is working ok, I cannot access the email log: I get an 404 error page. The url looks like this: https://www.domain.nl/index.php/admin/smtppro/log/index/key/d5cfab326f7c998a31dacf313a91d37c/

Any idea?]]></description>
