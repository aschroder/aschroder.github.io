If you decide to release it, I&#039;d consider setting it up. I have a client who&#039;s thinking about doing this now, but I&#039;m sure others can &#038; would use this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Joe Fletcher Hi Joe, I did create the autoresponders. I wrote up a bit post about them actually over here: http://www.world-wide-access.com/2010/11/24/a-case-study-in-automated-post-sale-ecommerce-customer-communication/

We have kept the functionality in-house for the time being, but I&#039;m always open to the idea of releasing it.

Also, thanks for the feedback on the comments. I&#039;m not sold on it personally - but I don&#039;t have time to rework it just at the moment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

Whoa! Love the new Comment View as I type this!

Curious, did you ever create the order auto responders for soliciting product reviews and feedback X days after an order? Surprisingly, I haven&#039;t found anything like that for Magento yet. Still looking...

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Sebastian, I don&#039;t have a really good solution for that, other than the list in Magento is sort of arbitrary in the scheme of things. The mailchimp solution makes the list Magento keeps internally redundant - I don&#039;t use it for anything once mailchimp is hooked up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ashley,

Great blog you have here, I&#039;m using you&#039;re smtp pro extension and when looking for a Magento Mailchimp Autoresponder issue I ended up here again :) I have the autoresponder working thanks to your little hack! So thanks a lot.

I was just wondering how you solved the issue that when a user UNsubscribes in Mailchimp it still subscribed in Magento, do you have a script that handles this via the Webhook? Love to hear your thoughts on this. Best Regards from Spain!  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ashley,

used your hint here and extended the extension to add a config param to insert the field tag. While at it, I also added the ability to select a grouping that the subscriber should be put into if a groups have been created for the list.

Good if you want to segment subscribers that use a join form on the store or blog...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That feature would be great. Soliciting a feedback from customers after 1-2 weeks would be a cool feature.

Looking forward to find out more about it :)

		<description><![CDATA[Tough call on the Campaign monitor vs Mailchimp. I think there is a pay-per-use account for Mailchimp too - I haven&#039;t used Campaign monitor, but do recommend Mailchimp to people. We use it for email marketing for several of the suppliers we represent in the US and have no complaints about the reliability or reporting they offer.(they should send me a t-shirt shouldn&#039;t they...).

I will be adding more autoresponder support for Magento in the future, particularly around soliciting product reviews/order feedback from customers 1-2 weeks after the order ships. Does Campaign monitor offer anything like that?]]></description>
