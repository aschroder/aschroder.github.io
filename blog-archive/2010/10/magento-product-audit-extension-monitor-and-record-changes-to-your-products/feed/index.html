		<description><![CDATA[Your solution is very intriguing and is partially what we are looking to for.  We would like to send product attribute updates (selected ones) to customers who currently have that particular product on order, but not yet shipped (ie backordered status).  How can we tie your system into a system that sends emails to customers and logs them in their order comment history?  Do you know of such an extension of functionality within Magento?  If not, is there code we can add that can do this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with annoying, here is my small contribution 
if($object-&#062;dataHasChangedFor(&quot;name&quot;)==1){
 $object-&#062;getOrigData(&quot;name&quot;);
}
tested and works, just have to type in all the attributes you would like to check. thanks again for the extension.   Maybe if I have some free time and feel in an array mood ill revisit this someday

		<description><![CDATA[@Shawn haha - noone is supposed to look at the code! Checkout the $_origData array on the entity - beforeSave it contains the data that the object had when retrieved _I think_.

I started implementing the diff, but it get&#039;s annoying dealing with object comparison.

If you do fancy implementing it, I&#039;d be very grateful to you!]]></description>

did you get anywhere on this? and/or do you know how to get the old data? if you do i can write this section just don&#039;t know how to get old data to compare the new data to.

		<description><![CDATA[@J.T. Good idea, so often we tweak the product description or name, but having a record of those changes over time and the associated  conversion rate would be very interesting.

I guess technically we should be A/B testing the changes before we make them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice, as always. First idea that sprang to mind is probably not the intended direction, but I immediately thought &#039;wouldn&#039;t it be nice to log that product page&#039;s performance/conversion up until that change so you can determine whether it has been beneficial&#039;. 

Within Magento, a simple product orders per pageview ratio could suffice, or interface it with the Analytics API and get the URL&#039;s dollar value and log it against that time stamp. If there were ever then to come a reporting interface, it could highlight the conversion/revenue impact of such product changes. 

But really, for mere auditing as a supervision project, it&#039;s a great tool as it is. ]]></description>
