		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Dustin - It&#039;s only tenuously related to sitemaps but... oh well. Sounds like a complicated Magento multi-store setup you have there. I&#039;d start by checking the base url for each store, it sounds like your browser is getting the store cookie set, but the stores all seem to share the same base url, which means that some of the urls will not exist in the different stores.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Schroder,

This is an excellent article. I am facing an issue would like to know if you have any suggestions. 

We are building a multi-store (3 stores with each having one english store-view). Now if i have an URL of a product (say www.abc.com/audi-q5) which belongs to car-stores which works well if i am already in the car store. But now if i click on some other stores lets say toy-store and then paste the url www.abc.com/audi-q5 i am getting &#039;page not found error&#039;. But now if i switch to the &#039;car-store&#039; and then paste this url it works fine. Now google-sitemaps are facing this same issue. For all the products in my default store (toy-store) it is able to find the page. but now when it tries to evaluate all other products in other stores like the car-store it gets the &#039;page not found error&#039;. 

now can you please advise me how to resolve this issue?

thanks,
dustin.]]></description>
