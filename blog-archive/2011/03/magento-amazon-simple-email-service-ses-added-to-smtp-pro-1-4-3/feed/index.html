		<description><![CDATA[Ok, first of all thanks for such an amazing extension.
For those who are getting MessageRejected error, go to IndexController.php and on Line 91 type your verified email id.

If you guys have production account, it&#039;ll anyway work without any problem.

Now for all those who are getting BCC error and aren&#039;t receiving mails on BCC id, just change send method from BCC to separate mails. It will work

Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[Made some mods to this excellent plugin to get DKIM working.

In the zip files are three files which you need to put in the lib folder 
/app/code/community/Aschroder/SMTPPro/lib

The file AmazonSES.php is already there and will have to be replaced with the version in the zip file ...

Link to the zip archive below
http://www.filedropper.com/aschroedersesdkim

In the file dkim-settings.php there are the instructions as well as the settings. Hopefully that will be all you need to get the DKIM thing working

The most politically correct way to do it is to ofcourse
1. Put all DKIM settings in Magento Backend (for the php retarded)
2. Override this code using the usual Magento gas of config files and directory structure.

I will however wait for someone else to produce a more politically correct version of this mod.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Kevin to fix that you need to go to Configuration &#062; Sales &#062; Sales Emails and change the drop down menu Send Order Email Copy Method from Bcc to Separate Email as Marcus suggested earlier - it does then work. 

I was getting an error that the test mail wasn&#039;t sending using SMTP PRO. I followed the instructions on this blog (another post) on how to remove a conflict line from the Ebizmarts Mailchimp extension and that fixed the problem. It&#039;s important to note that you need to address this clash even if you&#039;ve deactivated the Mailchimp extension (at least that&#039;s our experience). 

Looking forward to the Bcc error being fixed in future versions and hopefully the introduction of DKIM authentication.

We are now running SES on our live site.

Thanks Ashley.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I noticed that your email address is hard-coded as the &#039;from&#039; address in line 91 of the IndexController.php.

This causes the SES test email to fail because the &#039;from&#039; address needs to be an authorized sender.  When I manually change the line to be &#039;from&#039; one of my authorized senders, everything works.

I&#039;m not a Magento expert, but I assume pulling in the &#039;from&#039; email address from the website settings would fix some of the issues people are describing above.

Thanks for setting up this module - it&#039;s very helpful.]]></description>
