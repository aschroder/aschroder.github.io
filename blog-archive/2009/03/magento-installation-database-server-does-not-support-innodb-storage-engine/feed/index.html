		<description><![CDATA[I had the same problem, my hosting provider disabled InnoDB. They had suggested I purchase a VPS, which is a complete sham considering it is the current default database engine in MySQL. I decided to try Magento using MyISAM instead of InnoDB, I upgraded from version 1.5.1 to 1.7 without incident, using MyISAM. I do not know of any detriment to site stability, but it is working.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh damn that is terrible! Feel free to name and shame the host because honestly there is no excuse, security or otherwise, for mysql to not have innoDB enabled!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, this just happened to me as well. I rented a hosting and didn&#039;t quite check if they have innoDB enabled (checked everything else). So after few months we were ready to install Magento to live server, when it became clear we need InnoDB. And our host just won&#039;t enable it (&quot;due to security reasons&quot;). Now we have to find and move to another hosting provider, and take everything (hosting, static IP, certificate and domains) with us...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HA! I ran into this problem. I have a hosting reseller account which is much like a VPS, but you know that. The whole reason I started selling hosting is because I wanted to streamline my process a bit more and not be so spread out with my clients hosting &quot;who knows where.&quot;  Anyway I was also looking for a good place to launch my Magento world take-over from. A week later after I migrated my clients Magento release the new version and my hosting company announce they would no longer support Magento. To make a long story short, I crafted a very pointed email saying I would have no choice but to move on to a new hosting company. The next morning the Linux rep emailed me and said innoDB was installed on my server...fhew I am no heavyweight either, I have a rather basic reselling plan with about 10 clients on it. Magento is the future. No scratch that, Magento is future....I think that makes sense. I like you block, you are my first RSS subscription. Nice Work]]></description>
