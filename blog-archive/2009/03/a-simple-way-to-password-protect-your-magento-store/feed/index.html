		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering how this site has progressed with HTTP auth applied.

In recent times I have protected the development version of two magento instances prior to live using this method.

I always run into issues... Such as: 

Files referenced within CSS have full URL&#039;s from the secure https url (if you have one in place) fail to authenticate breaking design.

Uploading product images fail due to Flash uploader.

Plus more...

Normally all of the problems disappear as soon as I disable the HTTP auth basic.

I&#039;m interested to hear if this site function completely correctly and is still deployed within this context.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I am using the multiple website setup with subdirectories and I have been successfull at protecting my subdirectory, but I am constantly prompted multiple times for the username/password as I navigate the store.  For example, if I go from the root of my store &#039;/store1/&#039; to the cart page &#039;/store1/checkout/cart/&#039; I am prompted again.  Why is this if I setup the authentication at my store&#039;s root level?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is posible to only protect subdirectories - I assume the stores are
accessed as subdirecories? Or are they subdomains?

I had a great deal of trouble (and eventually gave up) trying to
&#039;unprotect&#039; a particular subdirectory. In reverse though it should be
easy, just only restrict access on a particular directory or
subdomain.

Let me know a bit more about your config and I could post a howto for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you know if there is way to password protect a single store within a web site? 

For example, if we have the following structure

Website
- Public Store
---- English Store View
---- French Store View
- Private Store
---- English Store View
---- French Store View

Is there a way to force password access to Private Store? 

The problem we’re trying to solve is that we want certain products to be available only to a select group (redirected from another web site).  The solution (a bit of a hack) is to set up those products only in the Private Store. We’d like to limit access to Private Store to those who have been given a username/password combination. 

Any ideas?]]></description>
