		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I have a question about the localhost IP and domain name.

Firstly I registered one domain name called vietyoung.org
Secondly, my Internet service provider gave me one static IP address. 123.45.67.89
Thirdly, I gave this IP address to my domain registry company and they points my domain name to this IP address.

Fourly, I installed Apache web server in my personal computer
and I tested this Apache web server installation successfully with the testing page when I type http://localhost/index.htm
However, when I typed in my domain name http://www.vietyoung.org, I got the issue about the page is not found or there is no internet connection. 

I checked that my index page is in the right document root folder as shown in localhost.
I checked that my internet connection is fine because I can view yahoo web page.

I try to configure the host file and virtual host file to set my static IP address and  domain name. But I cannot view my site under http://www.vietyoung.org

Can you tell me difference between the IP address of my computer or IP address of internet service provider?
Which IP address can be used?]]></description>

If that does not connect, then I&#039;d check for firewalls on CentOS, check Apache is listening on the right interface not just localhost.

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ashley,

Thanks for the post ... curious if you&#039;d be able to help me.

I&#039;ve created a VM of CentOS on my MacBook Pro with the ethernet set to Bridged. So, the VM has it&#039;s own static IP address of 192.168.1.111

Within the &quot;hosts&quot; file on the VM, I&#039;ve got:

127.0.0.1 dev.example.com

Within the &quot;hosts&quot; file on my MacBook Pro (the host machine), I&#039;ve got:

192.168.1.111 dev.example.com

Now the site works fine from within the VM, but doesn&#039;t pull up anything from the host MacBook Pro...

I&#039;ve spent literally 2 days trying to setup this stupid network and I have no idea what the issue is! :X]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Eric
Not sure if it&#039;s a copy paste issue, but your other box hosts file has: 
&lt;code&gt;192.168.1.156 jennylynne.net&lt;/code&gt;

That needs to match the &lt;code&gt;ServerName&lt;/code&gt; in the Apache config, which is &lt;code&gt;.dev&lt;/code&gt;. let me know if that was the issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ashley -

Thanks for the writeup.. I&#039;m in the middle of trying to accomplish exactly this.

Here&#039;s my setup:
MBP + MAMP + VirtualHost = My development environment

I want to view the websites I&#039;m currently developing from anywhere on my local network (exactly what this article lays out), but I&#039;m having some trouble here... :-/

This is my vhost file on my development box:
&lt;code&gt;
# Created Wed Feb  9 23:13:24 PST 2011
&#060;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&#062;
  DocumentRoot /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/jennylynne
  ServerName jennylynne.dev

  ScriptAlias /cgi-bin /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/jennylynne/cgi-bin

&#060;Directory /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/jennylynne&#062;
    Options All
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  &#060;/Directory&#062;
&#060;/VirtualHost&#062;

&lt;/code&gt;
Here&#039;s my /etc/hosts file from my development box:
&lt;code&gt;
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##

127.0.0.1 localhost
255.255.255.255	broadcasthost
::1         localhost 
fe80::1%lo0	localhost

127.0.0.1	jennylynne.dev
&lt;/code&gt;
Here&#039;s my /etc/hosts file from the computer on the same local network:
&lt;code&gt;
192.168.1.156 jennylynne.net
&lt;/code&gt;

The problem is that I simply get a directory listing of my /Applications/MAMP/htdocs folder when loading up http://jennylynne.dev on my &quot;local network&quot; computer, whereas when i go to the same URL on my dev box, the site loads up fine. any thoughts?

P.S. - I&#039;ve verified the IP address also..

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting post!

What would I do to connect to a folder on the remote machine, where my virtual host is set up? Can I do that?

Thanks]]></description>
