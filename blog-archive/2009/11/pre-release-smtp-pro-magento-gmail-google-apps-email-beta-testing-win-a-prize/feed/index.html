		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Mehran

Thanks for the comments - I think in the first case - During the self-test the fact you got no error message, and it reported send success is quite strange. Perhaps try installing the extension locally (not on a server at all) and check that it works there, if so you can isolate the issue to your server and then your server tech support may be able to help identify the issue?

On the gmail situation, that is also very odd - can you confirm you have tried more than one non-gmail ISP? perhaps if you haven&#039;t the one you have tried is spam blocking your gmail account? Can I suggest you make on brand new gmail and one brand new yahoo and use the new gmail to send test email to the new yahoo. If that works, then the problem is only the receiving ISP. 

Please report back and let us all know how you got on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ashley,

First of all, thanks for your great work. But I have two questions:

First, your SMTP connection isn&#039;t working on my linux vserver with Magento, I get this error messages:

ASchroder.com SMTP Pro Self-test results
Testing outbound connectivity to Server:
Failed to connect to Host SMTP server. Reason: ()
This extension requires an outbound SMTP connection on your specified port.
Sending test email to your contact form address xxx@xxx.de:
Test email was sent successfully.
Testing failed, please review the reported problems and if you need further help visit ASchroder.com to contact me.

And now about your GMail extension: It works good, when the customers have also GMail adresses. But for some reason, it&#039;s not sending mails to other hosts... It says &quot;Mail sent etc.&quot; but then I check inbox of another provider than GMail, it&#039;s empty. Am I doing something wrong? Same for the contact form, I&#039;m not receiving mails sent through it.

Please help me if you can, it&#039;s really important for me.

Thanks in advance
Mehran]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Mark

Sounds like you&#039;re having fun! The guys at Google have worked hard to make the apps onboarding process really clear and well explained, I&#039;d suggest you run through their steps for MX record setup - they even tailor them to suit GoDaddy if they detect that GoDaddy is your registrar. Don&#039;t rush it, if the Google apps dashboard still says you have things to activate, then you need to do that before trying to get onto the magento setup.

The error you are seeing from the self test is telling you that the gmail smtp is denying access (possibly because the account is not active, or you are using incorrect username and password).

If I find the time I&#039;ll try and make a screencast of the google apps setup process. But I bet others already have, did you try youtube?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m interning at a company and I have to connect google apps to their magento site. I&#039;m having a ton of problems.

1. to verify the site, i created an empty page on the default for google. which when you click on the link from google it shows the page and the code google needed however, inside google I get the test site

2. doing the self test on magento yields me this:
ASchroder.com Google Apps and Gmail Self-test results
Testing outbound connectivity to Google:
Connection to Google SMTP server successful.
Sending test email to your contact form address hello@example.com:
Unable to send test email. Exception message was: 550 5.7.0 Mail Sending denied. 20sm1552404ywh.2 ...
Please check and double check your email and password. If in any doubt you can login to the web interface for your email address to confirm at either &#039;mail.google.com/a/your_domain&#039; or &#039;gmail.com&#039;.
Testing failed, please review the reported problems and if you need further help visit ASchroder.com to contact me.

this worked for me the other day after trying google search after search but now this error is back and I can&#039;t find the solution

3. In order for me to add users and activate the email i need to change MX records, however I can&#039;t find this file. I was told by my boss that godaddy was the hosting. But that hosting if the proper address and not the address we currently have. (proper being shoppingirlgear and not shoppinggirlgear)
 they are currently transferring the proper site name from godaddy to magento.

any help would be great. I can&#039;t seem to ask anyone here because when i brought up the term DNS my boss said he didn&#039;t know what I was even talking about]]></description>
