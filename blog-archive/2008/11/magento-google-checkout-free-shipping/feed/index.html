		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Shane
If you post your XML from the integration console, the parts that say &#039;what we sent&#039; and &#039;what you sent back&#039; (or words to that effect) - obviously you&#039;d want to mask any sensitive info in the xml first! This might allow me to spot what is wrong. Cheers, Ashley]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I am receiving the following error for my store...

	Merchant Calculations: We were looking for data in your merchant-calculation-results, but were not able to find it: result: address-id:XXXXXXX

On the surface the problem I seem to have is that Google checkout doesn&#039;t process &quot;per item&quot; shipping. I am using the flat rate method and also an extension via the &quot;merchant calculated&quot; method.

Any help would be fantastic ! ( I am really struggling)

Many thanks
