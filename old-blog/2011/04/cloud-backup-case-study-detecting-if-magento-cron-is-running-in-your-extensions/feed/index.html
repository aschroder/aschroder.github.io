		<description><![CDATA[Hey Ash, Thanks for the heads up. I was playing around with this for a while on my test store and now moving it to a full production environment. You should probably get a signup via the PureHerbalCure store sometime today. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, SBR
At the moment Amazon keeps the Devpay S3 buckets separate/isolated from the user&#039;s own buckets - I&#039;m not 100% sure why they do that, probably security. In any case what it means is we cannot access your personal buckets, and you cannot access the backup buckets. It causes a lot of confusion so I will add a note to the admin area in the next release, but until Amazon changes the way their S3 service works, we can&#039;t do much about it I&#039;m afraid. Hope you&#039;re still keen to try it out despite that limitation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is there a way to send this to a S3 bucket in my aws account. Currently, it is sending to a bucket which is not controlled by us. So technically, I cannot physically view the contents of the bucket from my aws control panel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[really nice way to check it. Should maybe check that your specific task is running by filtering by the string of your job_code. Like in cron_schedule table &quot;export_apply_all&quot; job_code have at least one &quot;status&quot; set as &quot;success&quot;.

It&#039;s like an egocentric cronjob checker :p ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey J.T! I think instead of a module, I should add some sort of cron-calling functionality to MageSpeedTest.com - so you can request a call to /cron.php every 5,10,15,30,60 minutes for each store. Then you can get a daily summary if it misses any - though you would not get to see errors if they happen when it is called.

It can be a &#039;premium&#039; subscription feature! (Along with uptime and response time monitoring from 4 data centres globally). 
What do you think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just look in the DB. It&#039;s all there in one table. But would be nice to wrap this in an admin module and if it hasn&#039;t been running, you can click a &quot;run now&quot; button to go and manually trigger it asap. 

Cron is one of those principally simple things which has a knack of going wrong silently, with grave consequences. Often, things start faltering cumulatively, like with stock control etc. 

Any tools for early diagnosis are helpful. I sense a new Ashley-module coming... :) ]]></description>
