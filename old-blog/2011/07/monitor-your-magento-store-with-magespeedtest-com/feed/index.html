		<description><![CDATA[I think a good feature not to code, but for comparison, would be the description of rankings given i.e. the 1-5 ranks. (comparison chart of major websites and their volume vs magespeed test scores/data)

whats good, whats bad?  whats the average trans/sec that different sites should have?

if i had say, 10,000 page views per month, where should i be in terms of ranking?

this would help site owners and admins to determine if their host is up to snuff, and may consider switching to one of the hosts linked at the bottom, which im sure you are getting some kind of referral for, and wouldn&#039;t mind more of.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

Nice ideas, looking forward to the extension! I think you could do many things with that extension, like relating the number of sales to the speed of the website. Then it does become more of a shop monitor as mentioned by Patrick.

So, here&#039;s my problem: I&#039;m currently testing MageSpeedTest.com for my website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackmonitor.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://www.hackmonitor.com&lt;/a&gt;, notice the https://. It seems that the version of siege you are using does not support HTTPS and requires re-compiling (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.joedog.org/index/siege-faq#a13&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Siege FAQ: Does siege support HTTPS protocol?&lt;/a&gt;. Is that something you might plan on doing? ;-)

Thanks for this nice tool!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback. I&#039;m &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aschroder.com/2010/12/laying-siege-to-magento-performance-testing-your-magento-webstores/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;very transparent about how the testing works&lt;/a&gt; - it&#039;s not supposed to tell you if your payment gateway is down, or your products are out of stock, it tells you if your site is running fast or slow. With the latest release or monitoring it now tells you if it&#039;s running &lt;em&gt;slower&lt;/em&gt; than it used to as well.

I am planning to develop an extension that will allow the stores to publish urls for testing performance of customer actions like creating an account, logging in/out and adding to cart. 

Even with a server side extension publishing testable URL&#039;s, the test will still only be looking at performance, if you have a bug in your add to cart code, Mage&lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt;Test.com is not the tool for finding it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[your script is NOT a shop monitor.

you just take some urls from the sitemap, and meassure the response time - ab (apache benchmark) does the same.


anyway, a real shop monitor system will do much more - make test orders, report html/shop error messages and so on.


it&#039;s a nice attemp, but if yo launch such a project - do it right!]]></description>
