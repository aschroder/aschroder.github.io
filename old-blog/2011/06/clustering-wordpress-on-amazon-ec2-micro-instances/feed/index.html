		<description><![CDATA[Just a tip for anyone that doesn&#039;t know much about MySQL.  I followed the steps in this blog post but still couldn&#039;t connect to MySQL from neither my master node nor my web front-end node.  I kept getting a &quot;Error establishing a database connection&quot; error whenever I attempted to view my site in a browser.  After MUCH banging my head on the proverbial wall, I figured out that the TurnKey WordPress AMI I started with when I created my EC2 instances was set to bind MySQL to the loopback address AND the privileges for user root in the User table were restricting host to localhost only.

To resolve the error, I modified /etc/mysql/my.cnf and changed

bind-address		= 127.0.0.1
to
bind-address		= ec2-[elastic ip here with dashes].compute-1.amazonaws.com

So that fixed the binding issue.  To fix the permissions issue, I logged into MySQL as root on the console and added a new record to the User table in the mysql database as follows:

mysql -u root -p
[password]
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO &#039;root&#039;@&#039;ip-%.ec2.internal&#039; IDENTIFIED BY &#039;[password]&#039;;

This allows the root user to access MySQL from any host that starts with &quot;ip-&quot; and ends with &quot;.ec2.internal&quot;.  (FYI - I tested using telnet to see that the internal DNS name is what goes across the wire.

After those changes, I was able to connect to MySQL from both the master node and my web front-end nodes.

So if you&#039;re using a 3rd-party AMI as your starting image and can&#039;t connect to MySQL to save your life, check your /etc/mysql/my.cnf file and the mysql.User table!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

thanks a lot for your blog post. I am just starting to learn about EC2 and still have some questions:

How is your storage organized? Do you use an EBS volume for your master instance and the slave instances use the data via NFS?

Do you have different AMIs for the master and the slaves?


Cheers
Lars]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ashley, I have to applaud you on being one of the very few to actually think things through and have a viable aws scaling wordpress tutorial.  I&#039;ve tried them all, with a real 1000 page blog, and almost all of them can&#039;t run on a t1.micro - but your auto scaling solution does the trick.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

with the help of your post I managed to put my TYPO3 Website on ec2 instances. Thanks a lot.
One thing I came up with is that I had to open TCP-Ports in my security group for NFS. I&#039;m wondering if I configured something wrong or did you also open TCP-Ports for NFS?

Regards

		<description><![CDATA[Glad to hear it.

RDS is great, I just didn&#039;t need a dedicated DB server for a small Wordpress cluster. 

The database is hardly doing any work. For difefrent applications, such as Magento it&#039;d be ideal to use RDS, and the memcache server, so that the front end nodes can focus only on running the web app.]]></description>
