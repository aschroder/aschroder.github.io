I think it was X-Mas 2009, a media company sent a full-on spam-looking e-mail to all its clients and contacts saying something similar &quot;respond with this to get $10,000 for free&quot; - out of something in the order of 5K recipients just one or two responded (probably those who get scammed usually) and indeed they gave the money. Think it was this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4xHc2Ow9CY So the lesson is, play safe, give it a try!]]></description>
