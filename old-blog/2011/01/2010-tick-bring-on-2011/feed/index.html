		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the mention and right back at you. The last year has been great and with more to come this year. Looking forward to the meetup on Thursday.

I just started using 
http://www.worksmartlabs.com/cardiotrainer/about.php but it pretty much does the lot for tracking your exercises. So you really only need a new phone...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well done and may 2011 be even better! Take risk! 

Thanks for the mention too, likewise, great to meet you too! Took a bit of last-ditch communicado but glad it all turned out well.

Funny you&#039;d mention the XX (were we separated at birth by any chance?) they recently popped in my Spotify list and it&#039;s right up my sleeve too. Got to go see them live at some stage this year.

As far as GPS trackers go, combine it with a heart rate monitor and go for the Garmin 305. We used to sell Polar but Garmin seems to have taken over pole position in this area, especially if you need/want GPS. Bought this unit a few weeks back for a new hire of ours as a X-Mas prezzie. Amazon is full of praise for this and you can pick up a bargain now its successor has been launched (which doesn&#039;t warrant the extra cash IMO - unless you swim with it). 

Comes with good software but - you&#039;ll like this - there is some freeware out there which apparently is even better, integrates with Google Earth etc. Tech-gadgets like that will help you get that marathon ticked off this year (and get you in shape to fit your wedding dress :) )

Anyways, thanks for posting insightful stuff on Magento and web dev/tech in general. It&#039;s the only Mage source outside the official site I consistently follow and so far it&#039;s all I need! Bring on Mage 2.0 I&#039;d say :) Or even 1.5 seems to finally make a lot of sense feature-wise. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ashley, given your involvement with the community, you are certainly allowed a little narcissism as you ramp up for 2011.

Looking forward to what you&#039;ll be offering!]]></description>
