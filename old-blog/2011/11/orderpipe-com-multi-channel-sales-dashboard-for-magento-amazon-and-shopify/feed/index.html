		<description><![CDATA[Ashley, I&#039;ve got a number of multi-channel e-commerce clients who have been looking for a service just like this for a long time, but when I show it to them they all say they exact same thing: &quot;What about eBay?&quot;

Any chance that adding eBay is on the short list?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi
Would love to try the beta however currently I cannot save any roles in Magento version 1.6.1.0, I did a search on the topic and it seems to be a comment problem in Magento 1.6. Anyone found a workaround for this?
Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two of the greatest things about OrderPipe: 
1. It shows orders from all your sales channels aggregated into overall sales metrics. Maybe there are lots of people who sell only on one webstore, but for those of us that sell using several stores and marketplaces OrderPipe is the best way to get an immediate view of how things are going overall.
2. It is very clever in the way it works around the idiosyncracies (did I hear someone say severe failings?) of the Amazon MWS APIs. What this means is that even though Amazon seems to be doing its best to prevent it, OrderPipe gives you timely information about your sales through the Amazon Marketplace and Webstore-By-Amazon sales channels. Ever tried running Seller Central on your mobile phone, or trying to figure out what your Amazon sales are so far today? You&#039;ll love OrderPipe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.x.com/developers/x.commerce/products/x.commerce-developer-package&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this Fabric&lt;/a&gt; is what Vin was referring to - the bus for the X.commerce system eBay/Paypal/Magento are building. (so out of touch it seems, after missing an important Magento conference...)

This sort of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.x.com/sites/default/files/webform/docs/xcommerce/marketplace/order_find.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;API call&lt;/a&gt; will be very useful for eBay integration in OrderPipe (which is coming soon)

Also seems like a pathway to, I assume, Paypal&#039;s in-store/NFC payments for local brick and mortar stores (maybe)?

PS: whenever I hear the word &#039;bus&#039; mentioned with respect to webservices I shudder - it reminds me of the early to mid 2000&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ESB&lt;/a&gt; overkill. Fingers crossed that&#039;s not what fabric will turn out like!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very cool! One the x.fabric matures a bit more this would be a natural fit... just subscribe to order messages from any endpoint publishing them. Are you planning to use it as one input channel?]]></description>
