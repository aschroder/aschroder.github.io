		<description><![CDATA[How did I not find this blog post until now.  This is fantastic.  Looks like it&#039;s been a few years since you originally wrote this.  Do you still use more or less the same approach?  

I started off symlinking individual extensions (without modman), and that got a bit complicated, then moved towards a single repository for the entire project.  That&#039;s been nice, and it&#039;s always comforting knowing you can rollback the entire project in one `git checkout` if you need to.  But I&#039;m beginning to work on an extension that I need to deploy to multiple Magento instances, so I think it&#039;s time to go back to modman&#039;ing it up.

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As much for my future reference as anything else

This is a good line to delete all symlinks in a directory, which works well if you need to start from scratch on your modman setup, assuming of course that you haven&#039;t put any other symlinks in the magento installation

find . -maxdepth 1 -type l -exec rm -f {} \;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ashley,

Thanks for the reply!

After a few days of research, I&#039;ve also come to the conclusion that there isn&#039;t an easy/elegant way to do this.  What I think I&#039;ll have to end up doing is developing the custom theme / code changes off the live server to integrate when stable as there aren&#039;t too many database changes involved and those that are can easily once the 2nd site is live.  

Once I have a second, stable storefront up I can populate it with data (products, categories, etc) on the live site under a temporary test domain name, which will ensure that the data for both sites is reflected in the one live DB.

Again, not perfect, but the least complicated solution I&#039;ve seen.....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Andrew

Thanks for the feedback. That&#039;s a tricky situation.

Normally with new store&#039;s I&#039;d set up CMS blocks/pages via a module sql resource but in your case there&#039;d be a painfully large amount of configuration required.

I don&#039;t have a really good solution to your problem, I cheated a bit when I added a wholesale substore to an existing live retail store. I actually configured it as a substore on the live site, but developed the template and code changes (installing Vinai&#039;s Customer activation module for example) through modman as normal.

Maybe you could do a dump from core_config for the specific store, but there&#039;s lots of other settings to worry about too (i.e tax).

If you come up with a solution that works well please let us know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article!  There is a lot in here I&#039;ll be incorporating into my development methods.  I&#039;m currently struggling with an issue related to a multi-store development/engineering process I hope you might have some advice on.  We have two unique e-commerce sites and are in the process of migrating the non-Magento site to the Magento site.  The final result will be two unique domains, but one admin and code base.

However, I&#039;m not sure how to proceed given that one database supports both a live site and a development site.  As we develop the new Magento site offline, the live site&#039;s DB information is being changed.  Conversely, the information added on the development platform isn&#039;t reflected in the live site.  The problem is that two databases are constantly changing, and those changes need to be merged at launch of the second site.

I&#039;ve considered developing the new Magento site on the live server under a development domain (in order to share a DB with the live site), as well as trying to merge both versions of the database when we&#039;re ready to go live with the second Magento domain.  However, both seem like poor and/or complex solutions.  Based on your experience, could you offer any recommendations for this situation?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds quite similar to the way I was thinking, although i was thinking of using SVN externals rather than symlinks.

You do address that and are correct in that you can&#039;t re-tag in Subversion - but this is a problem which Git overcomes. You can have a designated stable branch (typically called &#039;master&#039;), and you can tag within a branch if you so wish (so you might have stable-1.0 and stable 2.0 for different sites). Or jsut use the HEAD revision. Any unstable developments can be done in other branches - thus not polluting the stable branch.

You would then set up a Git repo for each project and use submodules to pull in the Magento core and the various extensions you need, referencing the correct branches/tags.
