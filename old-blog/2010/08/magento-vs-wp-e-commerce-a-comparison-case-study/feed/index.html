		<description><![CDATA[I considering to migrate my store to Wp eCommerce, and I wonder about their support? I am going to use Cart2Cart tool to migrate data, because if I understood correctly, I should built my store design by myself in any case. I see comment from Dan who is the developer if this plugin. It is always pleasure to meet people from the backside. Nevertheless, thanks for comparison]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As payment gateway developer for wp based ecommerce solutions I really liked this article. Regarding your conclusion: &quot;So yes, for sufficiently small store projects, Iâ€™d do it again.&quot; 
Why not for a big store project? :-)

This is by the way a question I&#039;d like to invite the development teams of Woocommerce, Jigoshop, WPEC, Cart66 to consider as well. Why can a platform which is actually more lightweight, more user and seo friendly not be brought to the &quot;next level&quot;?

As far I can see it might these reasons:
- Anybody developing WP ecommerce systems has simply accepted the idea that WP based ecommerce is &quot;of course&quot; only for small shops
- there is not enough ecommerce infrastructure products around there for WP (e.g. ERP systems)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the article. Would be nice to see an update. I&#039;ve spent the last year moving all my sites from a customized php/mysql pfiend format to Magento. I have one site left, and now i&#039;m going bonkers. It doesn&#039;t make sense to have one site in WP and all the rest in Magento. But magento certainly does require me to have a programmer help me out. And i&#039;ve spent thousands of dollars making these changes.
Any comments on the SEO aspects? I&#039;m not sure if it was google panda or the site re direct, but when i moved one of my sites (www.AllAboutChi.com) from php to magento, i totally lost my # 3 ranking on Google. Now i&#039;m about 734!
I&#039;d appreciate any comments you might have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

I am a Web Developer by profession and we design and develop websites at Brandmantra.net.
I completely agree with what you have written in the article, to be more precise we offer wp-ecommerce solutions to 90% of our clients and except those you have a robust online store with lot of products we offer Magento.
Thanks for writing the informative article.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley.  Thanks so much for the post. Great insight.  I&#039;m getting involved with a site right now that&#039;s currently on Magento and feeling like I could do so much more for this business if it were on wordpress.  Site will have maybe 10 products, but potentially very high traffic...(at least that&#039;s the goal.. hmmmn, no really...)  
If you have a moment, I&#039;d really appreciate your thoughts on speed, etc with wordpress.  Looking into wpengine as well...
Regardless, thanks so much for the insight.
All the best,
Y]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comparison Ashley. 
I&#039;m about to dive back into Magento after building sites in WordPress. I&#039;ve found the woocommerce framework to be really great, but for larger operations WordPress just won&#039;t cut it.]]></description>
