		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley, Thanks for the fast reply. It sounds all good.

I grabbed myself an activation key, installed the extension and tried to create my first backup.

Unfortunately I see a &#039;500 Internal Server - This request takes too long to process, it is timed out by the server. If it should not be timed out, please contact administrator of this web site to increase &#039;Connection Timeout&#039; after approx 2mins.

I had a look at my .htaccess (I&#039;m using VPS.NET cloud hosting) and found &quot;php_value max_execution_time 18000&quot;.

I also had a look in the /var/backups folder and it looks like the &#039;cloudbackup-xxx.gz&#039; files are being created.

Not really sure where to look further. Also, I am seeing the same Cron error that &#039;Pat&#039; is. Is there any docos that show how to set up a cron job to run the extension?

Thanks a lot, Bruce.]]></description>

We use Amazon&#039;s DevPay - so you pay us, we pay them. No need for your own S3 account.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

I&#039;m looking for a Magento extension just like this one for backups.

Just a question about your charging model. You say the first GB is free and then 50c/GB/mth after that. Does the 50c/GB/mth include the S3 storage? (Or do I supply my own S3 acct?)

Cheers, Bruce.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks very good, for sure gonna give it a try. One stupid question I have is the hosting bandwidth of the server. When I schedule a full backup every night, let&#039;s say 400 mb isn&#039;t that gonna kill my hosting bandwith?]]></description>
