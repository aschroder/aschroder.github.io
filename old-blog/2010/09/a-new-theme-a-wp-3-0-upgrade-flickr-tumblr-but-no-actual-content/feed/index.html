		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback J.T - I&#039;ve raised some of these with Woo, including the fact that if you leave your website blank it puts in &#039;Your URL&#039; - pretty dumb. I just tweaked the CSS quickly, hopefully the colors are better now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did I mention escaping a&#039;postrophe&#039;s? Before submitting, they are escaped, after submitting, the slash shows up. And when I hit reply on my own comment, it prepopulates the text area with that entire comment. IS that intentional?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Weird? I use openSuse and Chrome. Nice update, it seems to work fine aside from...

1. Your avatar is a broken image icon. 

2. The grey text in this write a comment box is so light grey, I have to squint my eyes to see what I&#039;m reading. I take no responsibility for spelling mistakes. 

3. Scratch that, I now see my typing actually appears to the left as well. That&#039;s what you get when you are not a touch-typist and have to look at your keyboard...

4. The meny, I see you got what you wanted as for me, it turns in a search box once the footer is threatening to come in to view. 

5. My paragraphing, using enters, doesn&#039;t seem to be allowed. Do I need HTML?
 Yes? Yes! nl2br would be nice here. 
 The pics etc. are so far down, I doubt we&#039;d ever get to see it, which begs the question, why not move it up, or move it away?

Anyway, slick JS features and still very usable and readable. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t you hate spending several hours in something that on the grand scheme of things is inconsequential... Anyway - because it bugged me too, here&#039;s the fix:

&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://remysharp.com/2009/01/26/element-in-view-event-plugin/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;jQuery &#039;in view&#039; event plugin&lt;/a&gt; to detect when the footer is coming in to view.
&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
jQuery(&#039;#footer-outer&#039;)
    .bind(&#039;inview&#039;, function (event, visible) {
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;2)&lt;/strong&gt; When it&#039;s in view - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/slide-elements-in-different-directions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;scroll up&lt;/a&gt; the menu block.
&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
jQuery(&#039;.ribbon&#039;)
    .animate({ top: -400 });
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;3)&lt;/strong&gt; When it&#039;s back out of view &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/02/slide-elements-in-different-directions&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;scroll it back down&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
jQuery(&#039;.ribbon&#039;)
    .animate({ top: 0 });
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;4)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Extra merit&lt;/em&gt; - I added a little down arrow &#038;darr; that appears when the menu is scrolled away, that will manually pull it down.
&lt;pre lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;
&lt;a title=&quot;Show Menu&quot; 
href=&quot;javascript:showMenu();&quot;&gt;
&#8595;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
and
&lt;pre lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function showMenu() {
    jQuery(&#039;.ribbon&#039;)
    .animate({ top: 0 });
    jQuery(&#039;.down-arrow&#039;)
    .animate({ top: -30 });
}&lt;/pre&gt;

And there you have it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also a bit dubious about that left menu behavior. What I really would like is for it to stay fixed only until the footer comes in to view, and then for it to position:static. Not sure how to achieve that though. I&#039;ll have a nose around for something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting the persistent menu on the left, though not sure about it going over the photos on the left... I think this comment box is pretty cool. All imho of course!]]></description>
