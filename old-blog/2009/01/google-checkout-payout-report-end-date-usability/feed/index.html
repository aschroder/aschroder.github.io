		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the update - isn&#039;t it mental that still after all this time Google haven&#039;t just made selecting start and end dates default functionality? Oh Google engineers, please just make this very minor client side change for us?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uncanny timing! I just about 15 minutes ago sent this email to a reader who asked about my technique:

Still works - they have changed their code a little though.

There are two hidden fields that the form actually uses. The values
from UI elements are copied over &#039;onclick&#039; of the submit button. You
can use firebug to remove the javascript onclick, and the onchange of
the startdate UI field. Then just put value=&quot;d:2008-01-01&quot; (or the
date you want) attributes into the hidden fields and you&#039;ll be set!

I&#039;ll do a quick blog update for this later on tonight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just did something similar... I tried pasting your code, but wasn&#039;t successful.  They appear to have updated since with From and To select boxes.  However, I could only select back 90 days.  It was as opening firebug and changing the value=&quot;&quot; on the  that was selected, though, and I got all of 2008 in one file.  I&#039;ll have to pay those taxes now :)]]></description>
