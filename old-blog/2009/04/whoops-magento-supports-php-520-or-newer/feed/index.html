		<description><![CDATA[SOLVED!!
Yet I&#039;m embarrassed to admit that I was using my user account password rather than &quot;root&quot; as the password for root. I never knew. I hope this is helpful to someone else.

Thanks Ashley for the great site and help!

		<description><![CDATA[Well as usual it takes a reinstall. After a complete reinstall and complete reunpack of Magento I was able to get to the install panel. However, it just started looping when I got to the configuration screen. I set:

host: localhost
database name: magento
user: root
password: my password
base url: http://localhost/MYDOMAIN/magento/
admin path: admin

But when I click on continue it just keeps loaded this same page with no errors.

Also I did like you said and turned off MAMP and tried to reload the URL and got the page cannot be displayed so no second webserver which is good. :)

thanks,
Justin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does MAMP report 5.2.6 in it&#039;s phpInfo page too? Can you try stopping MAMP and then browsing back to the store URL, I wonder if it&#039;s possible Magento is actually running in another webserver, and not MAMP?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

I ran the version checker on all instances and they all come back as either &quot;this is a directory&quot; or &quot;command not found&quot;. EXCEPT

/usr/bin/php -v

which returns 5.2.6
And yes I do have MAMP set to use PhP 5. I&#039;m stumped.

thanks,
Justin]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your site has been really helpful to me so far in getting MAMP going. I am getting the &quot;whoops&quot; error even though MAMP says I&#039;m running 5.2.6. 

When I run grep I get:

/usr/bin/php
/usr/lib/php
/usr/share/zsh/4.3.4/functions/_php

I unpacked Magento into the htdocs folder in the MAMP folder.

Do I have too many php versions? Is there some conflict between the Php that came with OS 10.5.6 and MAMP?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[GADZOOKS! I have located an extra PHP using this method. Fantastic!

I suppose the question now is how to safely remove the undesired PHP. Or even better yet, just disable it. Google was not helpful on this one. The only way I know to do it is to comment it out in the apache config (httpd.conf).Â So I guess the next step is really to find out if another version of Apache is running? So I need to look deeper using my novice Terminal skills. I did an MDFIND httpd.conf and found a few suspects but none of the usual;

LoadModule php5_module        libexec/apache2/libphp5.so
LoadModule fastcgi_module     libexec/apache2/mod_fastcgi.so

to comment out. Perhaps there is a Includes calling the script? I did a MDFIND php5, but I did not find the culprit. Any suggestions?]]></description>
