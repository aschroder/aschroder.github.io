		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley, 
This is in addition to the email I just sent you. We have a domain where we would like to put the shop &#038; various other domains that would feed into it, as we get set up. We work in both English &#038; Icelandic &#038; would like to be able to have shops set up in each language as the Magento documentation shows, as we would like to be able to make materials available to other countries - esp. downloadable materials for places like Africa &#038; China. The shop would be on arorautgafa.com &#038; the other site is our charity site. I set up a zen-cart shop but it never worked well &#038; is down.
We would be so thankful for any help you can offer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Chris

I could try both, how about you describe what&#039;s going wrong, and if it&#039;s an easy fix, I can help you through it. Otherwise if it sounds tricky, I could just do the install for you. I still have 2 installs left on my &lt;a href=&quot;/2009/02/5-free-professional-magento-installations/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Free Magento Installations offer&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Rod

I have investigated the disabled Google Checkout button problem for you. I posted what I have discovered about this problem here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aschroder.com/2009/02/google-checkout-disabled-not-available-with-these-items/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Solving Disabled Google Checkout button in Magento checkout&lt;/a&gt;. Please let me know if that helps, I am interested otherwise to know what is causing your problem.

Also, if you would like to discuss &lt;a href=&quot;/services&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;re-installation of your Magento&lt;/a&gt; on a fresh server, contact me.

Thanks, 
Ashley]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would love to give you a great review in exchange for some assistance with my Magento install. 

I&#039;ve installed Magento, but a few features are not working correctly (Google Checkout, shipping charges, protection of CSRF attack, product category numbers are incremented too high).  Maybe a completely fresh install might be the answer.

I&#039;ve pulled my hair out on this for months hoping the next upgrade would solve the Google Checkout problem.  I gone through four upgrades to no avail of fixing the problem.  In fact, the upgrade to v1.2.1.1, has completely disable Google Checkout functionality.  All I get is a greyed-out Google Checkout button on my site.

Your intention to sell installation services is a great idea.  As I see it, Varien does not have a support plan that works for small businesses.  The market segment that you are aiming to service seems to be a good target.  Good luck!

Warm Regards,
Rod]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That wouldn&#039;t be very fair! How about one install to start with and if in a week or so the other 4 are not taken, then we can talk about the other stores. Contact me to discuss install requirements, my email link is on the services page and about page. Cheers, Ashley]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you interested in setting up google checkout for me instead? I have installed Magento fine myself, but I&#039;m looking for a way to make google checkout the only payment method (at the moment).

I noticed you posted on the topic, so I figure it&#039;d be just as easy for you, and I&#039;d be more than happy to write a glowing review :)]]></description>
