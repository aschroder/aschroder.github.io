		<description><![CDATA[So, I had Magento 1.7.0.2 CE running fine on MAMP using the http://localhost/magento/ URL, but had the problem with Chrome not being able to login.  I read about the issue with cookies and extending the Cookie Lifetime to 86400, but also understand that Chrome wouldn&#039;t accept any cookies not from a qualified domain, so it seemed like it was time to bite the bullet and implement this Virtual Server solution with MAMP.  After some playing with various configs, it is working fine with multiple fake domains pointing to plain index.html sites.

So my problem is somewhere in Magento.  Now when I goto the new domain, http://magdevsite.com it is redirecting straight away to http://localhost/magento/ where it was originally installed.  I have checked:
- .htaccess has:  RewriteBase /
- core_config_data has both unsecure and secure URL set to new domain (ej. http://magdevsite.com/ )
- pinging http://magdevsite.com/ resolves correctly to 127.0.0.1 

Can&#039;t figure out what is causing this!  Any ideas maestro?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit confused about the virtual subdomain in the hosts file...

If I already have Magento installed at example.com and I create a hosts entry for local.example.com, the Magento install example.com won&#039;t run, will it? Wouldn&#039;t I need to update the Magento database so it shows local.example.com as the site URL?

The issue I&#039;m running into is with certain paid extensions you have to give them the URL you are going to use. Any deviation from that URL and the extension will not work. So doing local development, I need to keep the URL the same as the live site. That&#039;s why I was thinking of using MAMP&#039;s ports, but I can&#039;t seem to get Magento configured to use those.

Any ideas?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

I am trying to set up local environment for one of my client&#039;s Magento sites.
I have copied their files and folders in my local folder and followed your instructions bt couldn&#039;t set up a local environment.
I took the backup of httpd.conf file.
I also edited the file and added the following line at the end of the file
#Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/sites
I created a text file called as sites in Applications/MAMP/conf/apache which has the following content
 NameVirtualHost *:80
 
 
 ServerName localhost
 DocumentRoot /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/foldername
 

But don&#039;t know how to edit etc/host and where it is located.
And have I done all the steps until here properly?
Please help !!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I setup a virtual host domain on my local MAMP Magento site, the
homepage would show up fine, but none of the links from the homepage
would work - I would get server errors.  I originally thought that the
problem was with my .htaccess files and Apache settings, but the
problem was actually in the /app/etc/local.xml config file.  The line:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;host&gt;&lt;![CDATA[localhost]]&gt;&lt;/host&gt;&lt;/code&gt;


...needed to be updated to reflect the exact name of the virtual host:

&lt;code&gt;&lt;host&gt;&lt;![CDATA[virtualhostname]]&gt;&lt;/host&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

I assumed that because the virtual host was local, and the mySQL
connection worked with localhost, this setting would be fine.
However, localhost won&#039;t work - it needs to be the virtual host name. 
A pretty obvious mistake, but one that is easy to make.   Hope this 
helps someone troubleshoot in the future......

		<description><![CDATA[I finally solved my magento issue of taking a site from a remote host to a local host and I thought my notes may help someone else

1. Check .htaccess file for #RewriteBase - my previous programmer had added rules

2. Check MAMP Preferences - Mine was set to PHP 5.3 when it should have been PHP 5.2

It has taken me almost 12 hours to resolve this, 3 times longer than the actual job. But now I can get on with the design changes.]]></description>
