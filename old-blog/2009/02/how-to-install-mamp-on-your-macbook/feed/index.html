		<description><![CDATA[This post is pretty old but I stumbled upon it when I was searching for an answer to the same problem as nick.

I got the same error:

My solution was to open the preferences box of MAMP and select the &#034;Ports&#034; tab, there I assigned the right ports:
Apache Port 8888
MySQL Port 8889

		<description><![CDATA[I am having the same issue as Nick. MySQL server will not connect and stays red. Is there a certain way I should have the WordPress files set up or maybe the Document Root? Or does that matter? I am also bot able to open the start page. What&#039;s weird is it all worked initially...and then I tried to organize the files and notta. Any thoughts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ashley,

I found your blog after having installed MAMP to run MySQL through the Netbeans IDE on my MacBook Pro. I ran into a problem for which I haven&#039;t yet had any response from the MySQL, MAMP, &#038; Netbeans forums. I&#039;m posting here in case you might have a solution.
------------------------------------
Problem: When trying to run PHP pages from a Netbeans project, I get following output

Hâ€‹â€‹â€‹
5.5.9â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹:*_$3re(â€‹Ã¿Ã·â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â‚¬â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹1^hou{-jQ5T&#039;mâ€‹ysql_native_password!â€‹â€‹â€‹Ã¿â€žâ€‹#08S01Got packets out of order


* &#039;garbage&#039; characters (e.g., &quot;$3re(â€‹Ã¿Ã·â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â‚¬â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹1^&quot;) vary

* &quot;H&quot;, &quot;5.5.9&quot;, &quot;mysql_native_password!&quot;, &quot;Got packets out of order&quot;, &#038; the error code remain same

* PHP pages DO display properly when I switch to Apache (but my DB is in MySQL)

***********************
MacBook Pro OS X 10.6.7

Netbeans 7.0
Java 1.6.0_24
MAMP 1.9.6
PHP 5.3.5

Running MySQL Server in MAMP at port 3306

In the Netbeans Services window, I&#039;m able to register MySQL Server as localhost:3306 [root] with the following properties:

Host Name: localhost
Port No.:  3306
User Name: root
P/word:    root

Admin Property paths...
Admin Tool:/Applications/MAMP/MAMP.app
Start Cmd: /Applications/MAMP/bin/startMysql.sh
Stop Cmd:  /Applications/MAMP/bin/stopMysql.sh

* In the Services window, able to create DBs, tables, &#038; execute SQL commands.

* But when I try to use MySQL Server from a NB PHP project (e.g., NB tutorial //netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/wish-list-lesson2.html), I only get the output noted above

* I uninstalled, and then re-installed, both NB 7.0 and MAMP, but with the same problem

Thanks for any assistance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley, 

Thats a pretty decent Mamp set up guide, I used this a while ago and it was damn helpful. Recently I changed the way I use mamp so that I could have my dev sites exactly the same as my live sites, like this:

http://www.mysite.dev
http://www.mysite.com

Here is my guide if it helps any one:
