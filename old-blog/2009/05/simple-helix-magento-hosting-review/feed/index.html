		<description><![CDATA[Hi Ashley,

Did you ever get that EC2 AMI project finished? I like AWS as well, but I don&#039;t that the tech skills to set up and secure my own instance. Looking forward to your post on this.

Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[Simplehelix.com is NOT a world class hosting solution!!! 10X faster Magento hosting means nothing when your server is down for three days due to VMS server failure. There is no Enterprise Managed Backup in place as promised from the company!  Their poor service has caused a major loss of revenue and a halt to everyday business. No e-mail, no data, no working website…  This is no minor error on the part of simplehleix.com it is a critical one and I highly recommend not investing in their product and if you have already move to a new host.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been hosting with Simple Helix since 2009 and I&#039;ve had no downtime due to their server upgrades nor any poor tech support. I found them while searching for a Magento host. I do wish that they offered more disk storage for the shared hosting though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My current ISP has had issues with one server that has two websites of mine which I monetize with AdSense.  I noticed a few months back that labs in Google webmaster tools showed a slowdown on page load speed, and I thought I noticed that too.  To make a long story short, I&#039;ve been checking around for a faster ISP, found SimpleHelix, and called and talked with someone over there a few weeks ago.  I actually planned on calling them tomorrow to switch ISPs, and then decided to check for reviews.  I am so glad I did!  What I like the most about this post Ashley, don&#039;t take offense, is the number of comments you&#039;ve received from dissatisfied customers.  Plus, your caveat at the end of your post stating you&#039;ve seen the bad reviews.  There is no way I can go forward with a company that has had this many bad reviews.  So, thank you for helping me make a decision!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[well now that I know that I can post comments here is my two cents. I think we should al stop writing reviews here. I&#039;m pretty sure this guy is an affiliate of Simple Helix Magento hosting provider and all the reviews and / or testing are bogus.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They claim to be fast and reliable. Here is the truth.

My site got hacked because one of their users had a malicious code injected into their site so it effected the whole server and all the websites got the virus.. now that I call reliable! lol. Also they are the slowest host I have ever seen, actually google stopped indexing my site because it was so slow.. take a deep breath if you go with simple helix.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you checkout the various live Magento stores listed at MagentoHost.info you can compare the load speeds of real live Magento stores for yourself for a variety of hosting providers.  In fact, there are quite a few live stores listed that are running in SimpleHelix&#039;s hosting environment.

This seems like a more realistic way to see the &quot;real&quot; Magento performance in a given hosting environment.  I&#039;m certainly not accusing anyone of anything but I&#039;m skeptical that some hosts might host their official Magento demo stores on servers with lighter than usual load.  It certainly could be tempting with the stiff hosting competition out there! Ashley - I&#039;m a fan of your Magento email plug-in by the way. Lots of good Magento information coming from you and this blog.  Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the feedback Fever, I think you make a good point and it&#039;s advice I follow myself. Do your own DNS, and your own backups - that way there you can just up and move if your host lets you down.]]></description>
