Thank you very much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Currently with Nexcess and they are wonderful! Haven&#039;t loaded any SKUs yet as we&#039;re still working on development, but the speed, price, and support is wonderful :). P.S: Some of your extensions have GREATLY helped out. We do appreciate the time you took creating them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ashley,
We are hoping to launch our new magento site within 2 weeks.  Been working on it for 2-3 months now.  Once I got alot of SKU&#039;s loaded in (and we have WAY more to go) it is getting really slow.  We are currently on the Crucial Web Hosting Split Dedicated Tier 1.  

I originally had WEBO Speedup loaded but ran into some problems so I rolled back to pre-install.  Do you have any current advise for hosting (e.g. Nexcess SIP-300 ?? ).  We need something that is going to really hum.  I will have about 150,000 SKU&#039;s, but we only show configurable sku&#039;s so there are many simple SKU&#039;s never seen.

I have enjoyed and learned from some of your other posts, so thanks!!

Do you recommend any &quot;speedup modules&quot; to install in addition to a particular hosting company?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Indeed, assuming you run all 25 stores from the same magento instance with the multiple store setup, it&#039;s still only 1 installation of Magento. There&#039;s nothing to stop anyone on our end or crucials end or properhosts end from creating 100 different folders on their account and installing magento in each of the folders either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[also note how many instances of the store is allowed to run on a server.

eg sip200 allows only 13clients BUT it could potentially host upto 325stores (each client is allowed 25 domains and instances).

others may not allow that many eg properhost, crucial etc]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Frank, this is direct from Nexcess:


&lt;blockquote&gt;The demo store is running on the SIP-100 plan which is apache and the server is shared with 29 other clients. The breakdown is like so:

SIP-100 - Apache - 30 clients total on the server
SIP-200 - Litespeed - 13 clients total on the server
SIP-300 - Litespeed - 4 clients total on the server
SIP-400 - Litespeed - 1 client dedicated server&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
