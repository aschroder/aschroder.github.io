		<description><![CDATA[It works perfect!

I have to change one parameter on my configuration: 
Go to System -&#062; Configuration -&#062; System, Open Tab: SMTP Pro Email General Settings:
Set &quot;Choose extension option&quot;: &quot;Google Apps/Gmail&quot;, and them It works.

Thanks again! Good job!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

i have problem (maybe there are few of them)

When I was using default magento sending system, client who buys a product receive an email, but I am (as owner) not receiving anything.

Installed your extension (in manual way), filled fileds with google apps data but now there are no emails for client and not for owner (tried with contact form, with purchase orders).

Tried to use smtp settings and filled google apps data, same problem continues

Tried with another simple smtp data (not google apps) - same problem continues again.

BUT when self-test are done (with google apps, smtp google apps and simple smtp data) everything looks good and I am getting test emails (test email and contact form example with your email).

What I am doing wrong?

Using magento 1.6.0.0, website is not in production state and all requests for that domain are redirected.
My server (virtual dedicated) isn&#039;t configured to send emails itself.

Maybe there is a problems?

P.S I have already used your extension in previous project and you helped me to solve another problem few months ago.

I need your help now too, I am ready to make a donation for you work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Justin

It points to a possible extension clash - some other extension is controlling the email send. Check the contact form test email headers, if it is sent via Google then it is probably a false alarm.]]></description>
